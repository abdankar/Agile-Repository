Depression and anxiety have been on the rise over the past few years, and
software engineer Yoni Levine has been applying Natural Language Processing and
Machine Learning algorithms on forums dedicated to supporting suicidal and
depressed people. By analyzing the data scraped from these algorithms, Levine
was able to find common words that indicated a shift from depressed to suicidal
tendencies. Some of these words included "hate", "cutting", and "pain".

This article concerns the debate regarding *tabs vs. spaces*.  
While I personally use ***tabs***, I was surprised to learn those who use **spaces** receive a larger salary than those who use **tabs**.  It was shown that across several countries that the majority of those who use **spaces** actually earn more, regardless of external factors such as firm, experience, or education.  

However, I will forever use *tabs*.
